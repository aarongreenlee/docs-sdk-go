= User Management

[abstract]
The SDK now lets you create _users_, assign them _roles_ and associated _privileges_, and remove them from the system.

== Listing Users

The basic form of the method used to return currently defined users is as follows:

----
List<User>getUsers()
----

The method returns a list of _User_ objects, each of which takes the following form:

----
User {
    String name;
    String id;
    String domain;
    Role[] roles;
}
----

The name is the full name of the user.
The id is the user's ID.
The domain is either `local` or `external`.
Each Role object in the Role-array has the form described above, under _Creating a User_.

== Removing Users

The basic form of the method used to remove users is as follows:

----
booleanremoveUser (String userid)
----

The method's sole argument is the id of the user to be removed from the system, specified as a _String_.
The method returns a _boolean_, which is `true` if the operation is successful, otherwise `false`.

== Language-Specific Variations

Each language supported by the Couchbase SDK implements the above methods in a slightly different way.
For Go examples, see xref:sdk-user-management-example.adoc[Sample Code].

== Further Information on RBAC

All aspects of the Couchbase RBAC system are covered in the section xref:6.0@server:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].
Specifically, for information on:

* Adding _Users_ and assigning _roles_, by means of the Couchbase Web Console, see xref:6.0@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].
* _Roles_ required for resource-access, and the privileges they entail, see xref:6.0@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].
* _Resources_ controlled by Couchbase RBAC, see xref:6.0@server:learn:security/resources-under-access-control.adoc[Resources Under Access Control].
