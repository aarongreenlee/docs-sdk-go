NOTE: See xref:n1ql-query.adoc[Couchbase Developer documentation for a quick intro to developing with N1QL]

== Simple Queries

You can issue N1QL queries by first creating a [.api]`N1qlQuery` via [.api]`gocb.NewN1qlQuery()`, and submitting the query to [.api]`Bucket.ExecuteN1qlQuery`

The following example shows how to send a simple N1QL query:

[source,go]
----
myQuery := gocb.NewN1qlQuery("SELECT * FROM default")
rows, err := myBucket.ExecuteN1qlQuery(myQuery, nil)
var row interface{}
for rows.Next(&row) {
        fmt.Printf("Row: %+v\n", row)
}
if err = rows.Close(); err != nil {
        fmt.Printf("Couldn't get all the rows: %s\n", err);
}
----

The returned value ([.api]`QueryResults`) may be iterated over using the [.api]`QueryResults.Next()` method, which may be passed a pointer to an object which may be converted from each row.
You may use an empty interface or a custom object containing JSON tags.
Note that the JSON fields in the row are controlled by the query string itself: See https://github.com/couchbaselabs/devguide-examples/blob/server-4.5/go/query-marshalling-rest.go[^] for an example of using typed query rows.

== Querying with Placeholders

You can use N1QL xref:n1ql-query.adoc#devguide-named-placeholders[placeholders] in the query.
Placeholders allow you to specify variable constraints for an otherwise constant query.
To use placeholders, insert the placeholders themselves in the query string - these may be positional (e.g.
`$1`, `$2`, etc.) or named (e.g.
`$age`, `$lname`, etc).
A named or positional parameter is a placeholder for a value in the WHERE, LIMIT or OFFSET clause of a query.
To set the value for the placeholders, construct an object of an appropriate type and pass it as the second argument to the [.api]`ExecuteN1qlQuery()` method:

* For positional placeholders, pass an array.
`$1` refers to the the first array element, and so on.
* For named placeholders, pass a Map.
The Map keys should match up to the named placeholders, without the sigil (`$`).
To specify a value for the `$age` placeholder, the Map should contain a value for `age`.

Note that placeholder values may be anything JSON serializable - meaning things such as Maps and arrays are accepted.

[source,go]
----
myQuery := gocb.NewN1qlQuery("SELECT airportname, city, country FROM `travel-sample` " +
        "WHERE type='airport' AND city=$1 ")
myParams = append(myParams, []interface{}{"Reno"})
rows, err := bucket.ExecuteN1qlQuery(myQuery, myParams)
----

== Query Options

You may configure the [.api]`N1qlQuery` object with various options to control query behavior.
These options may be configured using various setter/getting methods

* [.api]`N1qlQuery.Adhoc()` controls whether the query will be xref:n1ql-query.adoc#prepare-stmts[prepared].
* [.api]`N1qlQuery.Timeout()` allows you to set the per-query timeout.
This is useful for long-running queries
* [.api]`N1qlQuery.Consistency()` allows you to modify the query index xref:n1ql-query.adoc#consistency[consistency].

== Index Creation

In order to query a bucket, it must have an index defined.
You can create indexes using raw N1QL statements (e.g.
xref:6.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/createindex.adoc[CREATE INDEX]) or via the Go SDK's xref:managing-clusters.adoc[cluster management interface]
