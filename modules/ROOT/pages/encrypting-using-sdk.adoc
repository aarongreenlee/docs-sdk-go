= Field Level Encryption from the Go SDK
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Field Level Encryption is available in Couchbase Data Platform 5.5.

[#package]
== Packaging

The Couchbase Go SDK uses the `gocbencryption` library to provide functionality for encryption and decryption.

[source,go]
----
go get github.com/couchbase/gocbencryption
----

The Couchbase Go Field Level Encryption (FLE) library uses struct tags to specify which field(s) to apply encryption to and which algorithm to use.
The struct tag key is `cbcrypt` and the value is of the form `"provider"`.
Here’s an example struct definition:

[source,go]
----
type PersonAddress struct {
    HouseName    string `json:"houseName"`
    StreetName   string `json:"streetName"`
}

type Person struct {
    FirstName string        `json:"firstName"`
    LastName  string        `json:"lastName"`
    Password  string        `json:"password" cbcrypt:"myAESProvider"`
    Address   PersonAddress `json:"address" cbcrypt:"myAESProvider"`
}
----

[#encryption_configuration]
== Configuration

You need to create a Key Store, a Provider, and a Transcoder.
The provider is used to perform encyption/decryption and the transcoder is responsible for using the provider during operations.
You can register multiple (uniquely aliased) providers with a transcoder.
After installing the dependency you need to set up your Key Store, Provider, and Transcoder (note that the alias name of the provider matches the struct tags):

[source,go]
----
keyStore := &gocbfieldcrypt.InsecureKeystore{
    Keys: map[string][]byte{
       "mypublickey": []byte("!mysecretkey#9^5usdk39d&dlf)03sL"),
       "myhmackey":   []byte("myauthpassword"),
    },
}

aesProvider := &gocbfieldcrypt.AesCryptoProvider{
	Alias:    "myAESProvider",
	KeyStore: keyStore,
	Key:      "mypublickey",
	HmacKey:  "myhmackey",
}

coder := gocbfieldcrypt.Transcoder{}
coder.Register("myAESProvider", aesProvider)
----

Next you need to create a configuration to connect to your cluster and set your transcoder on the bucket:

[source,go]
----
cluster, _ := gocb.Connect("…")
cluster.Authenticate(…)
bucket, _ := cluster.openBucket("…", "")
bucket.SetTranscoder(&coder)
----

[#encryption]
== Transparent operation

You can then perform KV operations as usual and your data will be encrypted/decrypted automatically:

[source,go]
----
person := Person{
    FirstName: "Barry",
    LastName:  "Sheen",
    Password:  "bang!",
    Address: PersonAddress{
        HouseName:  "my house",
        StreetName: "my street",
    },
}

bucket.Upsert("p1", person, 0)
