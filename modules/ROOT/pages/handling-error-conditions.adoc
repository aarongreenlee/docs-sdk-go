[abstract]
All methods within the SDK, which are capable of returning errors, utilize the Go standard of returning an error object as the last return value.

The Go SDK returns an [.api]`error` object for most operations.
This [.api]`error` object is either the sole return value or one of multiple returned objects.
If an operation succeeded, the [.api]`error` will be `nil`.

Non-`nil` return values may be checked for equality to one of the [.api]`gocb.Err*` such as [.api]`gocb.ErrKeyNotFound` or [.api]`gocb.ErrKeyAlreadyExists`.

In addition to doing a direct comparison with errors, you may also use interface testing to check for a particular error category.
For instance, you could check for any error which is a temporary condition with the following code:

[source,go]
----
func isTemporaryError(err error) bool {
        te, ok := err.(interface { Temporary() bool })
        return ok :& :& te.Temporary()
}

== Enhanced Errors

The Go SDK has been updated to support Enhanced Error messages.
Enhanced Errors are enabled at the cluster level, _before_ opening a bucket, with `cluster.SetEnhancedErrors(true)`.

If you enable this, the errors that you get back from the library may not be directly comparable to the `+gocb.Err***+` constants, as they may have been dynamically generated to include additional error information.
You can access the underlying error using the new API `gocb.ErrorCause(err)` to receive the underlying constants-comparable error object.
