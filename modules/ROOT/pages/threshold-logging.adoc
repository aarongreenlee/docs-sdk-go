== Threshold Logging in Go

Response Time Observability is implemented in the Go SDK from version 1.4 onwards.
With `OperationTracingEnabled` set to true [the default in Couchbase Server 5.5], `operation_tracing` is passed in the cluster connection query string.
And with `OperationTracingServerDurationEnabled` set [it currently defaults to `false`], the `server_duration` is passed in the cluster connection query string.
This is a brief example of customizing the threshold settings.

[source,go]
----
cluster, _ := gocb.Connect("couchbase://localhost”)
// cluster, _ := gocb.Connect("couchbase://localhost?operation_tracing=true&server_duration=true”) example of using connection string options
cluster.Authenticate(gocb.PasswordAuthenticator{
    Username: username,
    Password: password,
})

tracer := gocb.ThresholdLoggingTracer{}
tracer.Interval = 1 * time.Second
tracer.KvThreshold = 500 * time.Millisecond
tracer.ViewsThreshold = 1 * time.Second
tracer.N1qlThreshold = 1 * time.Second
tracer.SearchThreshold = 1 * time.Second
tracer.AnalyticsThreshold = 1 * time.Second
tracer.SampleSize = 20
cluster.SetTracer(&tracer)  // Note that this must come before cluster.OpenBucket
