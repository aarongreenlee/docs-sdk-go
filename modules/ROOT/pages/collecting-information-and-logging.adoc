= Collecting Information and Logging in the Go SDK with Couchbase Server
:navtitle: Collecting Information
:page-topic-type: concept
:page-aliases: event-bus-metrics,logging,howtos:collecting-information-and-logging

The Go SDK offers simple logging of library internals to help debug issues.
Logging may be configured on a global library-level basis.
*Note that the logging API is subject to change*.

You can configure logging using the [.api]`gocb.SetLogger`, which accepts an implementation of [.api]`gocb.Logger`.
The SDK comes with two built-in [.api]`Logger` implementations, which can be instantiated using the following _methods_:

[[gocb.logger_instantiation_methods]]
* [.api]`gocb.DefaultStdioLogger()` returns a logger that logs errors and warnings.
This is fairly non-disruptive and does not produce a lot of output.
* [.api]`gocb.VerboseStdioLogger()` returns a logger that logs more detailed tracing information.
This logger should only be used when trying to diagnose an issue.

[source,go]
----
import (
        "github.com/couchbase/gocb"
)

func main() {
        gocb.SetLogger(gocb.DefaultStdioLogger())

        // Use the gocb library.
}
----

It is also possible to provide other logger implementations to [.api]`gocb.SetLogger`.
Implementations must satisify the [.api]`gocb.Logger` interface.

[source,go]
----
  type Logger interface {
	// Outputs logging information:
	// level is the verbosity level
	// offset is the position within the calling stack from which the message
	// originated. This is useful for contextual loggers which retrieve file/line
	// information.
	Log(level LogLevel, offset int, format string, v ...interface{}) error
}
----

The [.api]`gocb.DefaultStdioLogger()` and [.api]`gocb.VerboseStdioLogger()` wrap their [.api]`gocbcore` counterparts to provide a stable interface.
The [.api]`gocb` versions should be used.
